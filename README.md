**SimpleAccounting** is a simple software for accounting.
It supports double-entry accounting including split bookings and several reports.
Bookings can be imported from text files (CSV), e.g. provided by your bank account web access.

I started `SimpleAccounting` around 2005, only for my personal use to manage accounts and balances of a small club.
In 2019, I met a colleague from another small club who was looking for a simple solution to get an overview of the balances of several logical and real accounts.

So, I decided to rework my solution to make it usable for others and open source.

## Naming

The name says it all. The software is as simple as possible. 

It probably does not follow all rules and laws of double-entry accounting, e.g. the software does not protect accounting
entries from changes.
Instead it is explicitly possible to change existing entries.
The data is stored in readable XML format and can be changed manually.
An XSD document is available online and linked from the XML document which supports editing with code completion support.

The software focuses on journal and balance sheet reporting.

## Features

* Data management for double-entry accounting, stored as XML (see [example](./samples/sample.acml)) and defined using [XSD](./docs/AccountingData.xsd)
* User interface (English, German, and French) for the management of accounts, the creation and modification of entries,
  the listing of account journals
* Support for split booking entries, either on credit or debit side
* Import of booking entries from your bank account using CSV files incl. semi-automatic assignment of offsetting accounts
* Printable reports for full journal, account journal, accounts and balances, and annual financial statements
* Semi automatic update of the application

## Getting started

The application is based on [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0).
There is
a [self-contained package](https://github.com/lg2de/SimpleAccounting/releases/download/2.3.0/SimpleAccounting-self-contained.zip)
available. Using this package you do not need to install the .NET 8 runtime. I'll update this package with security
fixes if needed.
There is also a [small package](https://github.com/lg2de/SimpleAccounting/releases/download/2.3.0/SimpleAccounting.zip)
available which requires .NET runtime to be installed.
Please download and install the Runtime in
version [8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.0-windows-x64-installer)
or above.

Download one of the `SimpleAccounting` packages from
the [release page](https://github.com/lg2de/SimpleAccounting/releases).
Extract the ZIP archive into your preferred destination directory.

Start `SimpleAccounting.exe`.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome!

Small changes can be made immediately via Pull Request.
I will try to check and integrate it as soon as possible.
Medium and large changes should be discussed first.
Please open a new issue or participate in existing discussions.

## TODOs

I am German and have no experience with English or French terms in the financial world.
Therefore, I am pretty sure that some of the words I used are confusing for native speakers.
Perhaps you would like to help with better naming?

## Roadmap

The public releases are [available](https://github.com/lg2de/SimpleAccounting/releases).
Please download, test and send feedback.

The roadmap is defined by issues and milestones.
